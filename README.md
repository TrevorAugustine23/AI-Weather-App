Welcome to the AI Weather App GitHub repository! This project is dedicated to transforming the way small-scale farmers in rural African regions access and leverage weather information. At its core, the AI Weather App, powered by ChatGPT-4 and integrated with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and the OpenWeatherMap API, provides localized and precise weather forecasts tailored to the unique needs of farmers. A key feature of this repository is the Rainfall Prediction Model, utilizing historical weather data, including information from the OpenWeatherMap API, to predict rainfall patterns. Implemented with a classification approach using Random Trees, the model offers valuable insights for crop planning and resource allocation. We believe that by combining artificial intelligence, the MERN stack, and the OpenWeatherMap API, this repository not only delivers a user-friendly weather forecasting tool but also contributes to advancements in agricultural decision-making. Join us in exploring the code, contributing, and together, let's empower farmers with accurate weather forecasts and innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture.
